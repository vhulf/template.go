a go template for functional scripts, baseline support for arguments, more useful help sections and verbosity from which to build all sorts of tooling that feels good to work with!

try -h and -v, they should work - wowza what a nice scripting baseline for the gopher c:

oh, also please deviate from the verbose vs non-verbose output schema suggested, it's pretty yucky but just wanted to be clear in my template since I often utilize specific to use-case minimized output...
